### Change
We fixed some minor typos on the ports/testing.html doc page for OpenBSD.

### Documentation
Good documentation is critical for attracting new developers to your project. Good documentation also helps influence the creation of good code. If a project is dedicated to documenting its codebase, it is more likely to attract developers who care about code quality. This can produce a positive feedback loop.

### Lessons
I learned how to contribute to an actual large, open source project. It turned out to be easier to get into than I expected (at least for minor documentation fixes).

### Diff
The actual diff that I sent via email is in this directory as typo.diff.
